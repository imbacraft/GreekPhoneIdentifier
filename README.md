# Natural Numbers Interpretation Application

Project created for Omilia Ltd Academy.

It is a Java SE command prompt application that handles natural numbers interpretation.

The application has the following features:

1. Asks for user input.
For example, possible inputs may be:
input example: 30 2 5 58
input example: 2 10 69 30 6 60 4
input example: 6 97 400 23 7 40 5

2. Identifies and prints the input number.
For example, if input is: 30 2 5 58, output should be: 302558

3. Produces a series of possible interpretation, after checking ambiguities in number spelling.
For example if the input sequence contains ‘... 20 5...’ the result number may either be ‘...205...’ or ‘...25...’.
Also if the sequence contains ‘...75...’, the result number may be: ‘...705...’ or ‘...75...’

4. States which of the output numbers is a valid or invalid Greek telephone number, assuming the following:
Greek phone numbers may have 10 or 14 digits. If they have 10 digits, they must start with ‘2’ or ‘69’. If they have 14 digits, the must start with ‘00302’ or ‘003069’.
